                "Six weeks ago two Americans and a German were kidnapped while on a humanitarian mission in the city of Matala. During the first two weeks we had no information on their whereabouts or proof of life. That changed a little less than four weeks ago; at that time we received credible intelligence from a local Angolan official that they had a possible location on where the kidnapped aid workers were being held. Since then we have tasked 24-hour ISR on the region and we have seen an increase in movements of armed non-Angolan military groups in the region. These movements have been erratic and appear to be making a general movement towards the Atlantic Coast. Time is now critical to move in and recover the kidnapped workers as there is now a Russian Navy presence in the area. We believe that the Russians are planning to make a move to either kill or capture the ones responsible for the kidnapping. However; we can not let this happen. The three people captured were part of a NATO intelligence operation that was working to determine the presence of a previously known muslim extremist organization thought to have moved into the Angolan interior. This intelligence operation in Angola with the governments blessing since the Ban on Islam was reported here in 2013. During this time it was believed that Angola had taken a hard line stance against Islam and the Islamic community as a whole; this was deemed significant enough to warrant working with the Angolan government as they believe Islam is directly opposite to the state’s Christian values."
